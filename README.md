### Hi. I'm Evan. I'm currently a freelancer with a few web dev projects in motion.

Most of my activity as of late has been though [my GitLab](https://gitlab.com/evanhosni) where I host my repos for my game [[dotcomma]](https://dotcomma.io).<!-- I'm also working on developing an employee-facing site for a client as well as [FreeBeez](freebeez.org), a one stop shop for all the free stuff in your area. -->

I'm looking for full time employment doing what I love - developing fun, user-friendly applications. Don't hesitate to contact me at [evankhaledhosni@gmail.com](mailto:evankhaledhosni@gmail.com) if you are hiring or interested in collaborating with me!
